# Serverless Nodejs Rest API with TypeScript And DynamoDb

This is simple REST API example for AWS Lambda By Serverless framwork with TypeScript and DynamoDb.

## Use Cases

* Serverless Framework - Lamda

* CRUD

* Store data in DynamoDB

* Unit Test Jest. 

* CI/CD and support multi-stage deployments

## Project structure

The project code base is mainly located within the `src` folder. This folder is divided in:

- `modules` - containing the code base of each module and configuration for your lambda functions
- `shares` - containing shared code base between your lambdas
```
